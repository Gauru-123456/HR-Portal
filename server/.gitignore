*.log

#📄 node_modules/
#What is it?
#A folder created when you run npm install — it contains all your installed libraries.

#Why ignore it?
#It’s very large, and we don’t need to upload it.
#Anyone can regenerate it by running npm install.

#🔒 .env
#What is it?
#A file that stores sensitive information like passwords, database URLs, API keys.

#Why ignore it?
#To keep your secrets private — you should never upload .env to GitHub.

#⚙️ dist/
#What is it?
#The build output folder created by tools like Vite or Webpack (npm run build).

#Why ignore it?
#It's auto-generated, and we don't store it in Git — it can be built again when needed.

#📝 *.log
#What is it?
#This means “ignore all files that end with .log” — e.g., error.log, debug.log.

#Why ignore it?
#Log files are used for debugging and are not useful in the Git repository.
